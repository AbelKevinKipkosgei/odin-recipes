    <h2>Recipe description</h2>
    <p>
      Crispy fried chicken is a timeless comfort food loved for its crunchy
      golden coating and juicy, tender meat inside. The secret to achieving the
      perfect crisp lies in seasoning the chicken well and coating it in a
      flavorful flour mixture before frying. When fried at the right
      temperature, the exterior becomes beautifully crunchy while sealing in the
      natural juices of the chicken.

      at family gatherings, picnics, or casual dinners, crispy fried chicken
      never fails to bring people together. Itâ€™s a classic recipe that balances
      texture and flavor, offering satisfaction in every bite.
