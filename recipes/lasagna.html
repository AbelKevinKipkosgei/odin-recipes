    <h2>Recipe description</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering sheets of pasta with a
      rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel or ricotta mixture, and plenty of cheese.
      The meat sauce is usually prepared with ground beef or pork simmered in
      tomatoes, onions, garlic, and herbs like basil and oregano to develop
      deep, savory flavors. Between the layers of pasta and sauce, ricotta or
      béchamel adds creaminess, while mozzarella provides the gooey, stretchy
      texture that makes lasagna so comforting. Parmesan is often sprinkled on
      top for extra sharpness and to create a golden-brown crust during baking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dish is assembled in a baking dish by alternating layers of pasta,
      meat sauce, and cheese until it reaches the top, finishing with a generous
      layer of cheese. Once baked, the lasagna rests to allow the layers to set,
      making it easier to cut into neat squares. This hearty, flavorful dish is
      loved worldwide not just for its taste but also for its versatility, as it
      can be adapted with vegetables, seafood, or even fully vegetarian
      versions. Lasagna is often prepared for gatherings and family meals
      because it’s both filling and satisfying, making it the ultimate comfort
      food.
