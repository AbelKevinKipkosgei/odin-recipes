    <h2>Recipe description</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering sheets of pasta with a
      rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel or ricotta mixture, and plenty of cheese.
      The meat sauce is usually prepared with ground beef or pork simmered in
      tomatoes, onions, garlic, and herbs like basil and oregano to develop
      deep, savory flavors. Between the layers of pasta and sauce, ricotta or
      béchamel adds creaminess, while mozzarella provides the gooey, stretchy
      texture that makes lasagna so comforting. Parmesan is often sprinkled on
      top for extra sharpness and to create a golden-brown crust during baking.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dish is assembled in a baking dish by alternating layers of pasta,
      meat sauce, and cheese until it reaches the top, finishing with a generous
      layer of cheese. Once baked, the lasagna rests to allow the layers to set,
      making it easier to cut into neat squares. This hearty, flavorful dish is
      loved worldwide not just for its taste but also for its versatility, as it
      can be adapted with vegetables, seafood, or even fully vegetarian
      versions. Lasagna is often prepared for gatherings and family meals
      because it’s both filling and satisfying, making it the ultimate comfort
      food.

      <li>&frac34; cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Gather all your ingredients.</p>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>
      Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium
      heat until well browned.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 3</h3>
    <p>
      Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season
      with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian
      seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1&frac12;
      hours, stirring occasionally.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>
      Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles
      in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold
      water.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 5</h3>
    <p>
      In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons
      parsley, and &frac12; teaspoon salt.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 6</h3>
    <p>Preheat the oven to 190 degrees celsius.</p>
    <h3>Step 7</h3>
    <p>
      To assemble, spread 1&frac12; cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a
      9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce,
      overlapping slightly. Spread with &frac12; of the ricotta cheese mixture.
      Top with &frac13; of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1&frac12; cups
      meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with &frac14; cup Parmesan
      cheese.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 8</h3>
    <p>
      Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
      Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray
      or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 9</h3>
    <p>
      Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an
      additional 25 minutes.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 10</h3>
    <p>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</p>
