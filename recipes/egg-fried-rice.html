      Egg fried rice is a simple yet flavorful dish that combines fluffy rice
      with scrambled eggs, aromatics, and seasonings. Itâ€™s a staple in many
      Asian cuisines because of its versatility and ease of preparation. By
      stir-frying cooked rice with whisked eggs, soy sauce, and vegetables, the
      dish develops a rich, savory taste with just a few ingredients. The
      balance of textures-soft rice, tender eggs, and crisp vegetables-makes it
      both satisfying and comforting.
